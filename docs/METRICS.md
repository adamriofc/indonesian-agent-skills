## 1. Measured Metrics Summary

| Metric Name | Value | Exact Definition & Measurement Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository Version** | `v6.16.2` | SemVer string in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `registry/index.json` |
| **Canonical Plugins** | `6` | Plugin directories containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`legal-id`, `tax-id`, `hr-id`, `finance-id`, `marketing-id`, `strategic-id`) |
| **Agent Skills** | `88` | Total `SKILL.md` files registered across the 6 canonical plugins |
| **Deterministic Engines** | `39` | Pure Node.js calculation & regulatory diff engine modules in `engines/*.js` |
| **Golden Cases** | `121` | Static golden test cases across `27` domain files in `tests/golden/*.json` |
| **Benchmark Domains** | `27` | Domain JSON files in `tests/golden/` evaluated by `scripts/benchmark.js` |
| **Benchmark Assertions** | `434` | Explicit assertion statements in `tests/benchmarks/` (`business-scenario-regression.test.js`, `nlp-extraction-fixture.test.js`, `cross-domain-synthetic.test.js`) |
| **Total Test Assertions** | `526+` | Total explicit `assert.*` calls across all test files executed by `npm test` |

## 2. Distinction Between Assertion Metrics

To eliminate documentation drift and ambiguity:
- **Benchmark Assertions (`434`)**: Refers strictly to explicit assertions within the 3 benchmark suites in `tests/benchmarks/`.
- **Total Repository Test Assertions (`526+`)**: Refers to assertions executed across unit, matrix, integration, security, and benchmark suites in `npm test`.
