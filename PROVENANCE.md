## 2. Ruleset Lifecycle Status

```text
DRAFT       → Under preparation or unverified data
VERIFIED    → Checked against official government source
RELEASED    → Published in a versioned release
SUPERSEDED  → Replaced by a newer effective ruleset
ARCHIVED    → No longer applicable
```

All rules listed above carry status `VERIFIED` as of 2026-08-10. Active statutory rulesets resolved by engine runtime: `PPH21-2024`, `BPJS-2026`, `PKWT-2021`, `PHK-2021`, `THR-2016`, `UMKM-2022`, `PDP-2022`, `PPh23-26 (2023)` — see `engines/rules/` and `REGULATORY_PIPELINE.md` for review cadence.

---

## 3. Ruleset Cryptographic Integrity (Trust Anchor)

- `engines/rules/integrity.js` holds the SHA-256 manifest of every ruleset; `verifyRulesetIntegrity(filename)` is validated on every `npm test` run.
- The manifest is updated only alongside committed ruleset changes; releases publish `SHA256SUMS.txt` as the public anchor (see release notes).
- Trust model boundary: the hash binds **file content**, not issuer authentication (non-PKI, non-notarized). Issuer verification is performed through the human pipeline below.

## 4. Audit Scope Statement & Non-Claims

### 4.1 What this register claims (verified 2026-08-10)

1. **Link**: Every link was verified over HTTP (status 200) or verified manually via browser for anti-bot entries (see item 3 in 4.2).
2. **Financial values & rates**: Key figures (JP wage caps 2024–2026, PPh 21 TER rates, PP 35/2021 severance) were cross-checked against ≥2 independent sources before entering the ruleset.
3. **Time effectiveness**: Every ruleset carries `effective_from` / `effective_to`; the engine performs deterministic date-based selection.

### 4.2 Non-claims (explicitly out of scope)

1. **The `BPJS-2015` ruleset stores end-of-period cap values** (Rp 10.042.300, per the 2024 SE), not historical yearly values for 2015–2023. For per-year historical values, refer to each annual SE (register rows `BPJS-JP-2024`/`BPJS-JP-2025`).
2. **BPJS Ketenagakerjaan SEs are not published centrally as digital text**; third-party mirrors are used (`SECONDARY_MIRROR`) and their content is compared against official releases per branch office.
3. **MA Registry (KUHPerdata) and DJKI (UU 20/2016) entries block automated clients** (HTTP 403 anti-bot). Entries were verified manually via a human browser; links still point to official authorities.
4. **Perpres 59/2024** (limited amendments to health provisions) is in the review pipeline; current employer rates and wage caps still reference Perpres 64/2020. See `REGULATORY_PIPELINE.md`.
5. **Not notarization**: the SHA-256 checksum binds repository file content, not the issuer's digital signature. Issuer integrity is maintained through `CONTRIBUTING.md` (review board) and the regulatory pipeline.
6. **Accounting standards are not positive law**: PSAK/SAK EMKM (register Section 6) are professional standards issued by IAI; the finance formulas in the engines are standard math not bound to standard amendments. PSAK amendments are tracked through the issue/review pipeline, not runtime rulesets. The `SAK-IAI` page returned 404 for automated clients at verification time (the parent domain was verified live); entries are marked `OFFICIAL_PAGE` + verified manually.

## 5. Marketplace Policy Rules (Non-Statutory — Platform Policy)

The following rules govern marketplace fee engines (`rulesetId: MKPL-FEE-2024`, effective 2024-07-01 onwards). These are **platform commercial policies**, not statutory law, and may change without public gazette notice. Versioned as SSOT in `engines/rules/marketplace.json` with a mandatory 3-month review cycle.

## 6. Finance & Accounting Standard Register (Non-Statutory)

The finance engines (`engines/break-even.js`, `depreciation.js`, `npv.js`, `irr.js`, `loan-amortization.js`, `financial-ratios.js`, `working-capital.js`, `eoq.js`) implement **standard mathematical formulas** from management and financial accounting. They contain no numeric rulesets and are not bound to any statute. The standards below are referenced as presentation/measurement principles for the `finance-id` skills; amendments are tracked via the regulatory issue pipeline, never as runtime rulesets.

| Rule ID | Standard | Issuer | Access Path | Audit Status | Verified At | Verification Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FIN-BASIS-01` | PSAK 1 — Financial Statement Presentation (accrual, 3-statement linkage) | IAI | `STANDARD_REFERENCE` | `VERIFIED` | 2026-08-10 | [IAI — SAK](https://web.iaiglobal.or.id/SAK-IAI) (404 for automated clients; parent domain live — verified manually) |
| `FIN-DEP-01` | PSAK 16 — Fixed Assets: straight-line, double-declining balance (DDB), sum-of-years digits (SYD) | IAI | `STANDARD_REFERENCE` | `VERIFIED` | 2026-08-10 | [IAI — SAK](https://web.iaiglobal.or.id/SAK-IAI) (404 for automated clients; verified manually) |

| `FIN-SAK-EMKM-01` | SAK EMKM — Financial Statements for Micro, Small and Medium Entities | IAI | `STANDARD_REFERENCE` | `VERIFIED` | 2026-08-10 | [IAI — SAK](https://web.iaiglobal.or.id/SAK-IAI) (404 for automated clients; verified manually) |

> **Non-claim**: standards above are professional references (IAI), not positive law. Their formulas (NPV, IRR, amortization, EOQ, ratios, break-even) are invariant math; skill interpretations are advisory, and formal opinions require licensed accountants.
