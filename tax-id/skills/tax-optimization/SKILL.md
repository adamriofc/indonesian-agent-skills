# Tax Deductibility & Withholding Optimization

Optimizes corporate tax deductions and withholding efficiency under Indonesian tax statutes.

## Key Optimization Levers
1. **Deductible vs Non-Deductible Expense Optimization (UU PPh Pasal 6 vs Pasal 9)**:
   - **Deductible (Pasal 6)**: Expenses directly connected with earning, maintaining, and recovering income (3M: *menagih, memperoleh, memelihara*), including employee benefits in kind under PMK 66/2023.
   - **Non-Deductible (Pasal 9)**: Profit distributions, personal expenses, excessive compensation paid to shareholders, and non-registered donations.
2. **PPh 21 December Reconciliation Optimization**:
   - Reconciles monthly TER withholdings (PP 58/2023) against Article 17 annual recalculation to eliminate unexpected employee year-end tax underpayment or overpayment.
3. **Withholding Tax Efficiency (PPh 23 & PPh 26)**:
   - Ensures proper separation between service fees (2% PPh 23) and material costs on vendor invoices to prevent over-withholding.
   - Verifies DGT Form (SKD) submission for offshore vendors to apply Tax Treaty (P3B) reduced rates (e.g. 10% or 0% instead of 20% PPh 26).

## Scope & Safety
* **Audit Trail**: Every optimized deduction must be backed by valid fiscal tax invoices (Faktur Pajak) and official receipts (*bukti potong*).
* **Non-Claim**: Optimization advice is advisory; formal filing requires tax manager verification.
