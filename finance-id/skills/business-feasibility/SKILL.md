# Business Feasibility Study

A 5-aspect framework for assessing whether a new business is viable before funds are committed.

## Five Aspects
1. **Market**: size, segments, competitors, willingness-to-pay — primary validation (survey/pilot), not opinion.
2. **Technical**: production capacity, supply chain, workforce, technology — whether it can be executed.
3. **Financial**: initial investment, cash flow projections, payback, NPV/IRR (see capital-budgeting) — figures consistent across scenarios.
4. **Legal**: business permits (OSS), KBLI, certifications, taxation (NIB, NPWP, PPh final UMKM) — check the legal-id & tax-payroll-id plugins.
5. **Risk**: top 5 risks + mitigations; ±10% sensitivity test on price and volume.

## Rules
* All financial figures come from a single shared model (no floating numbers).
* Payback & NPV are computed with explicit assumptions (discount rate = simple WACC).
* Permits & compliance are not "later" items — they enter upfront costs & timeline.

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: go/no-go decisions, investor/bank presentations, prioritizing between business ideas.
* **Do not use for**: a guarantee of results — feasibility is an estimate, not a contract; include a disclaimer.
* Market data must be sourced (surveys, BPS, associations); do not fabricate figures.
* Legal feasibility requires an up-to-date check against OSS — verify at actual execution time.

## Worked Example
Input: coffee shop — investment 250 million (renovation 120 million, equipment 80 million, working capital 50 million); projected annual net profit ~72 million.
Output: Payback = 250 ÷ 72 ≈ **3.5 years**; at a 12% discount rate check NPV (capital-budgeting); market aspect: catchment ±5,000 workers, 3 competitors — validated with 100 respondents; legal: NIB + KBLI 56301; risk #1 location — mitigation: 3+2 year lease. Conclusion: feasible provided average volume is achieved.
