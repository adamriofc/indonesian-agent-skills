# Shopee Video Script & Tagging Optimizer

Generates 15-30 second video scripts optimized for Shopee Video algorithms and voucher conversion.

## Execution Framework
1. **Visual Hook (0-3s)**: Shocking visual or product demonstration.
2. **Feature Showcase (3-15s)**: Highlighting key benefits.
3. **Voucher Callout (15-20s)**: Directing viewers to claim Shopee Video vouchers.
4. **Yellow Basket Tagging**: Directing users to click the Shopee Video product tag.

## Tagging & Algorithm Notes
* Tag the product in the **first & last frame** (the video MUST be tagged for commission/reach eligibility).
* Write a 1-2 sentence caption with the main keyword at the start; include 2-3 relevant hashtags.
* Upload via Seller Center → Shopee Video → pick the category & voucher — videos with vouchers get placement priority.
* Duration 15-30s; 9:16 aspect ratio; 2-3 words of overlay text per scene.

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: product demos, restocks, flash-sale teasers, short tutorials.
* **Do not use for**: medical/efficacy claims without authorization, fake testimonials, or competitor price comparisons that cannot be proven.
* **Voucher truth**: only advertise vouchers that are actually active on the account; sync product stock before the video airs.

## Worked Example
Input: `product: "vacuum cleaner cordless 600W" / promo_angle: "fur pet removal"`
Script 15s: Hook (0-3s): dirty floor full of fur → (3-10s): demo sucking the fur in one clean pass → (10-15s): *"There's a 20% voucher on this video — click the product tag below!"* + 2-sentence caption: *"Powerful 600W cordless vacuum that lifts pet fur. Check out the voucher!"* + product tag + hashtags #vacuumcleaner #petowner.
