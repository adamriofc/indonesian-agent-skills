# B2B Wholesale Trade Negotiator

Formulates trade terms for bulk buyers, distributors, and reseller networks.

## Core Negotiation Terms
1. **MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity)**: Tiered price breaks based on quantity.
2. **Payment Terms**: CBD (Cash Before Delivery) vs TOP (Term of Payment - Net 14/30).
3. **Territory Protection**: Regional distribution exclusivity limits.

## Negotiation Playbook
* **Anchor first**: open with list price + volume incentive (undersell rarely helps).
* **Concession ladder**: discount 2-3% per 25% volume increase; never reveal floor margin.
* **Payment escalation**: new buyers = CBD; TOP 14 only after 2 clean orders; TOP 30 = distributor tier.
* **Territory clause**: verbal commitments without a written map = dispute source — always formalize in an SPK (see the `spk-generator` skill).

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: B2B wholesale, distributor & reseller talks, event/PSPO deals.
* **Do not use for**: retail/consumer pricing, government tenders without procurement regulations, or verbal agreements as a substitute for written contracts.
* **Legal note**: exclusive distribution agreements can have competition-law implications (Law No. 5/1999) when they foreclose the market — consult counsel if the market is dominant.

## Worked Example
Input: `buyer: "East Java distributor" / volume: "500 pcs/month" / target_margin: "30%"`
Term sheet: MOQ 300 pcs ↔ tier A price; 500 pcs ↔ tier B (4% discount); TOP 14 with a written PO guarantee & 30% down payment (DP); territory: exclusive East Java + Bali; maximum price increase 1x/year with 30 days' notice.
