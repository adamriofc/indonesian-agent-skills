# WhatsApp Broadcast Copywriter

Generates high-conversion WhatsApp direct marketing copy structured to avoid spam triggers.

## Structural Guidelines
1. **Hook Line**: Notification-first 2 lines capturing attention without sounding like generic spam.
2. **Body**: Under 150 words. Use 2-3 short paragraphs with clean line-breaks.
3. **CTA**: Single, clear call to action.

## Anti-Trigger Writing Rules
* Personalize with the recipient's name or specific need, not mass greetings (*"Hello everyone"*).
* Avoid high-risk words commonly filtered as spam: *FREE!!!, 100% DISCOUNT, CLICK NOW, NO-COLLATERAL LOAN* — replace them with context & value.
* Do not use short external links (bit.ly) in the first message — use official store links or the WhatsApp Catalog.
* Include an opt-out: *"Reply STOP to stop receiving promo updates."* (electronic communications compliance & healthy CRM practices).

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: promos, restock info, order follow-ups, event invitations.
* **Do not use for**: phishing, illegal offers, or sending without a legitimate-interest basis — Law No. 27/2022 on Personal Data Protection (UU PDP) requires a legal basis for data processing; mass broadcasting without consent risks number blocks & complaints.
* **Data source**: contact lists must come from lawfully obtained data (customers who have transacted / opted in).

## Worked Example
Input: `promo_angle: "restock of favorite skincare" / features: ["10ml serum", "SPF 30"] / cta: "catalog"`
Output: *"Hi Rina 👋 Your favorite serum is back in stock — 10ml size with SPF 30. Good news: this week there's a value bundle + free pouch.* [2 lines of details] *Want to see the catalog? Reply 'CATALOG' anytime. Reply STOP to opt out of updates anytime."*
