# Competency & Culture Fit Interview Scorecard

Builds structured interview rubrics checking technical skills and workplace cultural alignment (*Integrity, Gotong Royong (Mutual Cooperation), Resilience*).

## Evaluation Metrics (Scale 1-5)
1. **Technical Mastery**: Direct role-based problem-solving capability.
2. **Work Ethic & Integrity**: Honesty in reporting and adherence to company NDA/IP policies.
3. **Collaboration & Teamwork**: Ability to handle interpersonal conflicts and cross-departmental coordination.
4. **Adaptability**: Resilience during operational pivots.

## Scorecard Rules
* Each metric is scored 1-5 using **real behavioral examples (STAR)** — not general impressions; structured interviews over impressionistic judgment.
* Scale anchors: 1 = no evidence, 3 = partial/situational evidence, 5 = repeated & consistent evidence.
* Two separate interviewers score independently → compare and discuss any delta greater than 1 point before finalizing.
* Avoid illegal questions: marital status, religion, ethnicity, pregnancy (UU 13/2003 & non-discrimination) — replace them with competency-based questions.

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: screening, panel interviews, promotion assessments.
* **Do not use for**: ongoing performance appraisal (use a separate performance framework), or employment termination (PHK) decisions based on interviews alone.
* **Data privacy**: interview records are personal data — store with restricted access; delete failed candidates' records per policy (UU PDP No. 27/2022).

## Worked Example
Input: `role: "Admin E-commerce" / specs: ["order management", "CS handling", "basic excel"]`
Scorecard: Technical (3.5: e.g., track record of managing 200 orders/day during the pandemic), Integrity (4: honestly reported stock discrepancies), Collaboration (3: CS-logistics conflicts handled via regular meetings), Adaptability (4: completed the migration to a new system within 1 month). Average 3.6 → panel comparison → decision. STAR question: *"Tell me about a time you entered an order incorrectly — what did you do?"*
