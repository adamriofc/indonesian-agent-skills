# SIPP BPJS Portal Administration Guide

Step-by-step operational manual for HR teams managing BPJS Ketenagakerjaan employee mutations on the SIPP Online portal.

## Core Operational Workflows
1. **New Hire Onboarding**: Mutasi Data > Tambah Tenaga Kerja. Input NIK, Name, Date of Birth, Salary.
2. **Employee Offboarding (Nonaktif)**: Mutasi Data > Tenaga Kerja Keluar. Must submit prior to the 25th of the month to prevent billing in the next cycle.

## Compliance Checklist
* **JHT/JKK/JKM/JP enrollment**: mandatory from the first day of employment (UU 24/2011 jo. PP 45/2015) — do not wait for the probation period to end.
* **Wage reporting**: report the full wage (not base salary only) — this is the basis for contributions & claims; errors = contribution shortfall + penalties.
* **Deadlines**: wage changes/JP wage ceiling (see `engines/rules/bpjs.json`) → update SIPP in each new SE (Surat Edaran / circular) period; offboarding ≤ the 25th.
* **Verification**: after submitting, check the "Approved" status and retain the proof; contribution documents are kept for audit (min. 5 years).

## Scope & Safety
* **Use for**: membership mutations, periodic reporting, contribution status checks.
* **Do not use for**: contribution calculation — use the `bpjs-calculator` engine; claim/benefit decisions rest with BPJS (not the company).
* **Risks**: reporting negligence (late/underreporting) = arrears + administrative fines; report to the authorities if any employee data discrepancies are found.

## Worked Example
Input: `task: "register new hire"` — Data: NIK 3174..., name, date of birth, wage Rp 8.000.000, JKK low.
Flow: Login to SIPP → Mutasi Data → Tambah Tenaga Kerja → enter NIK + personal data → wage Rp 8 million → JKK low risk → submit → check the Acknowledged/Approved status → record the reference number. Contributions (run the engine): JHT 4%+2%, JP 2%+1% (cap Rp 8 million), JKK 0,54%, JKM 0,3%.
